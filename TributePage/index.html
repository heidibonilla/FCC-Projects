    <div class="paragraph-summ">
     <p>Sir Isaac Newton, (born Jan. 4, 1643, Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died March 31, 1727, London), English
      physicist
      and mathematician. The son of a yeoman, he was raised by his grandmother. He was educated at Cambridge University
      (1661–65), where he discovered the work of René Descartes. His experiments passing sunlight through a prism led to
      the
      discovery of the heterogeneous, corpuscular nature of white light and laid the foundation of physical optics. He
      built
      the first reflecting telescope in 1668 and became a professor of mathematics at Cambridge in 1669.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-summ">
     <p>He worked out the fundamentals of calculus, though this work went unpublished for more than 30 years. His most
      famous
      publication, Principia Mathematica (1687), grew out of correspondence with Edmond Halley. Describing his works on
      the
      laws of motion (see Newton’s laws of motion), orbital dynamics, tidal theory, and the theory of universal
      gravitation,
      it is regarded as the seminal work of modern science. He was elected president of the Royal Society of London in
      1703
      and became the first scientist ever to be knighted in 1705.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-summ">
     <p>During his career he engaged in heated arguments with several of his colleagues, including Robert Hooke (over
      authorship
      of the inverse square relation of gravitation) and G.W. Leibniz (over the authorship of calculus). The battle with
      Leibniz dominated the last 25 years of his life; it is now well established that Newton developed calculus first,
      but
      that Leibniz was the first to publish on the subject. Newton is regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all
      time.</p>
